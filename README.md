## Design
* We decided to build an application for a popular milk tea spot in San Jose called Gong-cha.
* The whole project is separated into four main division: three microservices and one backend RestAPI.
* The RestAPI is implemented and deployed On GKE beforehand for microservices to make use of.
* Each microservices is written within it's own folder and main running class, executing separately.
* However, all microservices shares the same MySQL database through the backend API for consistency.

### 1. Cashier App

The Cashier App is used by the baristas to take in and process orders and their payments. This will call the CyberSource API to handle payments.

# 

### 2. Online Store

The Online Store manages customer data, such as user credentials, the user's card information, user's cart, and generating orders.

# 

### 3. Backoffice Help Desk

The Backoffice Help Desk is used by managers to change user's credentials.

# 

### 4. REST API

The REST API processes api calls to manage orders, customers, and cards, which will be called in the [Cashier App](###cashier-app), [Online Store](###online-store), and the [Backoffice Help Desk](###backoffice-help-desk).
